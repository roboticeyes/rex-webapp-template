# REX WebApp Template

This repository contains a simple example about how to develop your own REX-powered web app.
The sample uses NodeJS and Express, but the web app can use any of the existing frameworks.

The only requirements are:

* OAuth2 authentication client
* REST client

In order to successfully connect your app with REX, you have to have a valid REX account.
In order to get your clientId and clientSecret, currently need to contact support@robotic-eyes.com.

In future REX releases, you will be able to register your app directly from the REX webportal.

## Build/Start

In order to start the sample you just have to call `npm start`.
